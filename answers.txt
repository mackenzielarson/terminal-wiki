1. What are the contents of the options variable? 
options = {"memory", "assembly", "compiler", "custom"}

2. Describe what is wrong with this section of code
return options[-1] is out of the range of the array. The option 4 will also not work. It must become return options[choice-1]

For questions 3 and 4 I unfortunately deleted the section of sample data (the garbage) that was in repository . cpp before I realized I needed it to answer these questions. The data was an array with {1, 2, 3} in it followed by a large number. 
3. 
4. 

5. Such a high number will throw off the array. For whatever reason, the array might freak out.
